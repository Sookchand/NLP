# Sentiment Anaysis Using Naive Bayes

This project was to carry out sentiment analysis of movie reviews using a Naive Bayes classification model. The data set used was the movie reviews from the NLTK corpus. The model was used to classify the movie reviews into two classes - positive and negative.

The steps taken to carry out the sentiment analysis were as follows: 
1.Downloading the required packages and data set 

2.Extracting the file ids for the positive and negative reviews

3.Loading the reviews 

4.Creating labels for the reviews 

5.Splitting the data into a training and testing set 

6.Calculating the tf-idf features from the training set 

7.Training the naive Bayes model for prediction 

8.Evaluating the model performance 

9.Evaluating the sentiment for each sentence in a review 

10.Plotting the variation of sentiment

## Lessons Learned

The performance of the model was evaluated using the classification report. The main classification metrics used were precision, recall, F1 score and accuracy. The model performance was found to be good with a precision score of 0.91 and a low recall score of 0.57 for positive sentiment.

The model was also used to evaluate the sentiment for each sentence in a review and the variation of sentiment was plotted. The graph showed that with increase sentence the model performance was consistent and reliable.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the Naive Bayes classification model can be used for sentiment analysis of movie reviews.
